# Exercise Tracker with MERN stack
This is a project done based on this [freeCodeCamp tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CqJlxBYj-M). The tutorial shows how to build a website by using *React, MongoDB, Express and Node.js*. What I did on my own was to mix those tools with **React-Redux, Redux-Saga, Formik (also with Yup) and React-Bootstrap**. It has no purpose rather than to practice. What I mean is that it doesn't do anything special nor solves any problem.

It is simple exercise tracker that lets yout:
- Add a new "user"
- Create a new Exercise, with some information
- See the exercises
- Delete and edit those exercises

It **doesn't have authentication, anyone can do anything on the data**.

## Some things I have to learn and look forward to
- Handling API calls, with something like a *"loading"* component
- Other React frameworks like Material UI or React Styled Components
- Node and relational databases
- Authentication and registering users
- Everything related with backend...
